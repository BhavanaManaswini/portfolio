**About Me:**  
I'm Bhavana Manaswini, a Frontend Developer with 3 years of hands-on experience building scalable web applications using React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I specialize in performance optimization, clean architecture, and pixel-perfect UIs.

**Experience**

*Internship*
I started my career as a Full-Stack Development Intern at Capgemini in March 2022, where I was trained in React.js and Java Spring Boot. My first web development project was building an Online Eye Clinic—a single-page application (SPA) that allowed patients to book appointments, view doctor availability, and manage medical records. During this project I:

1.	Implemented global state management using Context API for seamless data flow across components.
2.	Designed a responsive UI using Bootstrap and ensured cross-browser compatibility.
3.	Optimized performance using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback, reducing unnecessary re-renders by 30%.

--------------------------------------------------

*Full time*
After my internship, I transitioned into a full-time Senior Software Engineer role at Capgemini, working on three major projects that expanded my expertise in frontend and full-stack development.

--------------------------------------------------

Project 1: Insurance Web Application (React.js)
Frontend Developer | Oct 2022 – Sep 2023

I worked as a React.js developer for an insurance client, contributing to a high-traffic web application. My role evolved from debugging to full feature development. Key contributions:

1.	Fixed critical UI bugs, improving application stability and enhancing user experience.
2.	Developed reusable components, reducing code duplication by 20% and speeding up future development.
3.	Integrated REST APIs using Fetch, handling asynchronous operations with Promises and robust error handling.
4.	Optimized performance using React.memo, lazy loading, and code-splitting, reducing load times by 30%.
5.	Implemented Redux Toolkit (RTK) for efficient state management, making the app more scalable.
6.	Enhanced performance further by applying memoization (useMemo, useCallback) to minimize re-renders.
7.	Built responsive and accessible web pages following modern UI/UX best practices.
8.	Optimized side effects management using React’s useEffect hook for data fetching, event listeners, and state synchronization with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and unnecessary re-renders.
9.	Developed file upload/download functionality with validation using React refs.
10.	Managed complex state logic using useState, useReducer, and custom hooks.
Tech Stack: React.js, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Material UI, CSS, Redux (RTK)
Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub, Postman

--------------------------------------------------

Project 2: API Documentation Portal (Next.js Full-Stack)
*Full-Stack Developer | Sep 2023 – Aug 2024*

In this role, I worked closely with an UI/UX designer and built more than 50% of the application independently. This was my most challenging and rewarding project. Key contributions:

1.	Designed a secure authentication system using Next-Auth with JWT and later extended it to role-based access control (RBAC).
2.	Built an API documentation portal where users could view, test, and trigger APIs with real-time responses.
3.	Developed public/private routes using Next.js middleware, restricting unauthenticated users while allowing logged-in users full access.
4.	Integrated MongoDB for data storage, designed schemas, and built CRUD APIs for product management.
5.	Created a data-driven dashboard with dynamic visualizations using Chart.js.
6.	Translated Figma designs into pixel-perfect UI, collaborating directly with designers.
7.	Implemented Excel file handling (upload, download, validation) using ExcelJS.
8.	Optimized SEO performance using SSR(Server Side Rendering), SSG(Static Site Generation), and ISR(Incremental Static Regeneration) rendering strategies.
9.	Used React Hook Form + Zod for robust form validation.
10.	Improved API efficiency with React Query for client-side caching.
Tech Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, MongoDB, Next-Auth, React Hook Form, Zod, React Query, Chart.js
Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub, Postman

--------------------------------------------------

Project 3: Banking Portal (React.js & Microfrontends)
Frontend Developer | June 2024 – Present

Currently working on a large-scale banking application with a microfrontend architecture. Key contributions:

1.	Integrated independent features into a Microfrontend architecture using Module Federation.
2.	Debugged and resolved UI inconsistencies (fonts, styling, layout issues).
3.	Worked with a shared component library and CSS-in-JS for consistent theming.
4.	Wrote unit & integration tests using React Testing Library (RTL) & Jest, achieving 90%+ coverage.
5.	Deployed changes in development environments using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for testing changes.
6.	Implemented client-side tagging (Telium) for user behavior analytics & tracking.
7.	Ensured accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation.
8.	Collaborated with backend teams and integrated APIs using axios.
9.	Conducted performance audits using Lighthouse.
10.	Architectured custom hooks to abstract complex logic (API calls, form handling) across multiple projects.
Tech Stack: React.js, JavaScript, Microfrontends, Jest, RTL, CSS-in-JS
Tools: VS Code, Git, GitHub, Jenkins
